To combat this risk, molecular surveillance of drug resistance is imperative. We report the prevalence of mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum kelch 13 propeller domain associated with partial artemisinin resistance, which we determined by using Sanger sequencing samples from patients enrolled in therapeutic efficacy studies from 9 sub-Saharan countries during 2014-2018. Of the 2,865 samples successfully sequenced before treatment (day of enrollment) and on the day of treatment failure, 29 (1.0%) samples contained 11 unique nonsynonymous mutations and 83 (2.9%) samples contained 27 unique synonymous mutations. Two samples from Kenya contained the S522C mutation, which has been associated with delayed parasite clearance; however, no samples contained validated or candidate artemisinin-resistance mutations.",2021,Kenya
1,A review of the frequencies of Plasmodium falciparum Kelch 13 artemisinin resistance mutations in Africa.,"Ndwiga L, Kimenyi KM, Wamae K, Osoti V, Akinyi M, Omedo I, Ishengoma DS, Duah-Quashie N, Andagalu B, Ghansah A, Amambua-Ngwa A, Tukwasibwe S, Tessema SK, Karema C, Djimde AA, Dondorp AM, Raman J, Snow RW, Bejon P, Ochola-Oyier LI",10.1016/j.ijpddr.2021.06.001,"Artemisinin resistance (AR) emerged in South East Asia 13 years ago and the identification of the resistance conferring molecular marker, Plasmodium falciparum Kelch 13 (Pfk13), 7 years ago has provided an invaluable tool for monitoring AR in malaria endemic countries. Molecular Pfk13 surveillance revealed the resistance foci in the Greater Mekong Subregion, an independent emergence in Guyana, South America, and a low frequency of mutations in Africa. The recent identification of the R561H Pfk13 AR associated mutation in Tanzania, Uganda and in Rwanda, where it has been associated with delayed parasite clearance, should be a concern for the continent. In this review, we provide a summary of Pfk13 resistance associated propeller domain mutation frequencies across Africa from 2012 to 2020, to examine how many other countries have identified these mutations. Only four African countries reported a recent identification of the M476I, P553L, R561H, P574L, C580Y and A675V Pfk13 mutations at low frequencies and with no reports of clinical treatment failure, except for Rwanda. These mutations present a threat to malaria control across the continent, since the greatest burden of malaria remains in Africa. A rise in the frequency of these mutations and their spread would reverse the gains made in the reduction of malaria over the last 20 years, given the lack of new antimalarial treatments in the event artemisinin-based combination therapies fail. The review highlights the frequency of Pfk13 propeller domain mutations across Africa, providing an up-to-date perspective of Pfk13 mutations, and appeals for an urgent and concerted effort to monitoring antimalarial resistance markers in Africa and the efficacy of antimalarials by re-establishing sentinel surveillance systems.",2021,"Tanzania, uganda, rwanda, rwanda"

The spread of resistance has been described using genetic markers which are important epidemiological tools. We carried out a temporal analysis of changes in allele frequencies of 12 drug resistance markers over two decades of changing antimalarial drug policy in Kenya. We did not detect any of the validated <i>kelch 13 (k13</i>) artemisinin resistance markers, nonetheless, a single <i>k13 allele</i>, K189T, was maintained at a stable high frequency (>10%) over time. There was a distinct shift from <i>chloroquine resistant transporter (crt</i>)-76, <i>multi-drug resistant gene 1</i> (<i>mdr1</i>)-86 and <i>mdr1</i>-1246 chloroquine (CQ) resistance alleles to a 99% prevalence of CQ sensitive alleles in the population, following the withdrawal of CQ from routine use. In contrast, the <i>dihydropteroate synthetase (dhps</i>) double mutant (437G and 540E) associated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance was maintained at a high frequency (>75%), after a change from SP to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs). The novel <i>cysteine desulfurase (nfs</i>) K65 allele, implicated in resistance to lumefantrine in a West African study, showed a gradual significant decline in allele frequency pre- and post-ACT introduction (from 38% to 20%), suggesting evidence of directional selection in Kenya, potentially not due to lumefantrine. The high frequency of CQ-sensitive parasites circulating in the population suggests that the re-introduction of CQ in combination therapy for the treatment of malaria can be considered in the future. However, the risk of a re-emergence of CQ resistant parasites circulating below detectable levels or being reintroduced from other regions remains.",2019,"Kenya, kenya"

A comprehensive antimalarial drug resistance surveillance program is vital for detecting the potential emergence of resistance to antimalarials, including current artemisinin-based combination therapies. An antimalarial drug resistance surveillance study involving 203 Plasmodium falciparum malaria-positive children was conducted in western Kenya between 2010 and 2013. Specimens from enrolled children were analyzed in vitro for sensitivity to chloroquine (CQ), amodiaquine (AQ), mefloquine (MQ), lumefantrine, and artemisinin derivatives (artesunate and dihydroartemisinin) and for drug resistance allele polymorphisms in P. falciparum crt (Pfcrt), Pfmdr-1, and the K13 propeller domain (K13). We observed a significant increase in the proportion of samples with the Pfcrt wild-type (CVMNK) genotype, from 61.2% in 2010 to 93.0% in 2013 (P < 0.0001), and higher proportions of parasites with elevated sensitivity to CQ in vitro. The majority of isolates harbored the wild-type N allele in Pfmdr-1 codon 86 (93.5%), with only 7 (3.50%) samples with the N86Y mutant allele (the mutant nucleotide is underlined). Likewise, most isolates harbored the wild-type Pfmdr-1 D1246 allele (79.8%), with only 12 (6.38%) specimens with the D1246Y mutant allele and 26 (13.8%) with mixed alleles. All the samples had a single copy of the Pfmdr-1 gene (mean of 0.907 Â± 0.141 copies). None of the sequenced parasites had mutations in K13.

9,"Emergence, transmission dynamics and mechanisms of artemisinin partial resistance in malaria parasites in Africa.","Rosenthal PJ, Asua V, Conrad MD",10.1038/s41579-024-01008-2,"Malaria, mostly due to Plasmodium falciparum infection in Africa, remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world. Standard treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria is artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), which includes a rapid-acting artemisinin derivative plus a longer-acting partner drug, and standard therapy for severe P. falciparum malaria is intravenous artesunate. The efficacy of artemisinins and ACT has been threatened by the emergence of artemisinin partial resistance in Southeast Asia, mediated principally by mutations in the P. falciparum Kelch 13 (K13) protein. High ACT treatment failure rates have occurred when resistance to partner drugs is also seen. Recently, artemisinin partial resistance has emerged in Rwanda, Uganda and the Horn of Africa, with independent emergences of different K13 mutants in each region. In this Review, we summarize our current knowledge of artemisinin partial resistance and focus on the emergence of resistance in Africa, including its epidemiology, transmission dynamics and mechanisms. At present, the clinical impact of emerging resistance in Africa is unclear and most available evidence suggests that the efficacies of leading ACTs remain excellent, but there is an urgent need to better appreciate the extent of the problem and its consequences for the treatment and control of malaria.",2024,"Rwanda, uganda"

We evaluated the efficacy of ACTs recommended for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in five sites in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC): artemether-lumefantrine (AL), artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ), and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP). Children aged 6-59 months with confirmed Plasmodium falciparum malaria were treated with one of the three ACTs and monitored. The primary endpoints were uncorrected and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-corrected 28-day (AL and ASAQ) or 42-day (DP) cumulative efficacy. Molecular markers of resistance were investigated. Across the sites, uncorrected efficacy estimates ranged from 63% to 88% for AL, 73% to 100% for ASAQ, and 56% to 91% for DP. PCR-corrected efficacy estimates ranged from 86% to 98% for AL, 91% to 100% for ASAQ, and 84% to 100% for DP. No pfk13 mutations previously found to be associated with ACT resistance were observed. Statistically significant associations were found between certain pfmdr1 and pfcrt genotypes and treatment outcome. There is evidence of efficacy below the 90% cutoff recommended by WHO to consider a change in first-line treatment recommendations of two ACTs in one site not far from a monitoring site in Angola that has shown similar reduced efficacy for AL.

Recently, the artemisinin resistance phenotype was attributed to mutations in portions of a P. falciparum gene (PF3D7_1343700) encoding kelch (K13) propeller domains, providing a molecular marker to monitor the spread of resistance. The P. falciparum cysteine protease falcipain-2 (FP2; PF3D7_1115700) has been shown to contribute to artemisinin action, as hemoglobin degradation is required for potent drug activity, and a stop mutation in the FP2 gene was identified in parasites selected for artemisinin resistance. Although delayed parasite clearance after artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) has not yet been noted in Uganda and ACTs remain highly efficacious, characterizing the diversity of these genes is important to assess the potential for resistance selection and to provide a baseline for future surveillance. We therefore sequenced the K13-propeller domain and FP2 gene in P. falciparum isolates from children previously treated with ACT in Uganda, including samples from 2006-7 (nâ=â49) and from 2010-12 (nâ=â175). Using 3D7 as the reference genome, we identified 5 non-synonymous polymorphisms in the K13-propeller domain (133 isolates) and 35 in FP2 (160 isolates); these did not include the polymorphisms recently associated with resistance after in vitro selection or identified in isolates from Asia. The prevalence of K13-propeller and FP2 polymorphisms did not increase over time, and was not associated with either time since prior receipt of an ACT or the persistence of parasites â¥2 days following treatment with an ACT. Thus, the K13-propeller and FP2 polymorphisms associated with artemisinin resistance are not prevalent in Uganda, and we did not see evidence for selection of polymorphisms in these genes.",2014,"Uganda, uganda, uganda"

Using gene editing, we show that R561H, along with C580Y and M579I, confer elevated in vitro ART resistance in some African strains, contrasting with minimal changes in ART susceptibility in others. C580Y and M579I cause substantial fitness costs, which may slow their dissemination in high-transmission settings, in contrast with R561H that in African 3D7 parasites is fitness neutral. In Cambodia, <i>K13</i> genotyping highlights the increasing spatio-temporal dominance of C580Y. Editing multiple K13 mutations into a panel of Southeast Asian strains reveals that only the R561H variant yields ART resistance comparable to C580Y.

However, genome-wide discovery methods, such as haplotype scans for signatures of natural selection, are hindered by missing genotypes in sequence data. Poor correlation between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the P. falciparum genome complicates efforts to apply established missing-genotype imputation methods that leverage off patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD). The accuracy of state-of-the-art, LD-based imputation methods (IMPUTE, Beagle) was assessed by measuring allelic r2 for 459 P. falciparum samples from malaria patients in 4 countries: Thailand, Cambodia, Gambia, and Malawi. In restricting our analysis to 86 k high-quality SNPs across the populations, we found that the complete-case analysis was restricted to 21k SNPs (24.5%), despite no single SNP having more than 10% missing genotypes. The accuracy of Beagle in filling in missing genotypes was consistently high across all populations (allelic r2, 0.87-0.96), but the performance of IMPUTE was mixed (allelic r2, 0.34-0.99) depending on reference haplotypes and population. Positive selection analysis using Beagle-imputed haplotypes identified loci involved in resistance to chloroquine (crt) in Thailand, Cambodia, and Gambia, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (dhfr, dhps) in Cambodia, and artemisinin (kelch13) in Cambodia. Tajima's D-based analysis identified genes under balancing selection that encode well-characterized vaccine candidates: apical merozoite antigen 1 (ama1) and merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1). In contrast, the complete-case analysis failed to identify any well-validated drug resistance or candidate vaccine loci, except kelch13.

Nineteen nonsynonymous mutations were present in the pre-ACT samples (<i>N</i> = 64) compared with 22 in the post-ACT samples (<i>N</i> = 251). Eight of these mutations were present in both pre- and post-ACT parasites. Interestingly, seven of the shared single-nucleotide polymorphisms were at higher frequencies in the pre-ACT than the post-ACT parasites. The A578S mutation reported in SSA and the V568G mutation reported in SEA were found in both pre- and post-ACT parasites, with their frequencies declining post-ACT. D584Y and R539K mutations were found only in post-ACT parasites; changes in these codons have also been reported in SEA with different amino acids. The N585K mutation described for the first time in this study was present only in post-ACT parasites, and it was the most prevalent mutation at a frequency of 5.2%. This study showed the type, prevalence, and frequency of K13 mutations that varied based on the malaria ecological zones and also between the pre- and post-ACT time periods.",2018,Kenya

67,The Diversity of the <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> K13 Propeller Domain Did Not Increase after Implementation of Artemisinin-Based Combination Therapy in Uganda.,"Conrad MD, Nsobya SL, Rosenthal PJ",10.1128/AAC.01234-19,"Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the standard of care to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria. However, resistance to artemisinins, defined as delayed parasite clearance after therapy, has emerged in Southeast Asia, and the spread of resistance to sub-Saharan Africa could have devastating consequences. Artemisinin resistance has been associated in Southeast Asia with multiple nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (NS-SNPs) in the propeller domain of the gene encoding the <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> K13 protein (K13PD). Some K13PD NS-SNPs have been seen in Africa, but the relevance of these mutations is unclear. To assess whether ACT use has selected for specific K13PD mutations, we compared the K13PD genetic diversity in clinical isolates collected before and after the implementation of ACT use from seven sites across Uganda. We detected K13PD NS-SNPs in 16 of 683 (2.3%) clinical isolates collected between 1999 and 2004 and in 26 of 716 (3.6%) isolates collected between 2012 and 2016 (<i>P</i> = 0.16), representing a total of 29 different polymorphisms at 27 codons. Individual NS-SNPs were usually detected only once, and none were found in more than 0.7% of the isolates. Three SNPs (C469F, P574L, and A675V) associated with delayed clearance in Southeast Asia were seen in samples collected between 2012 and 2016, each in a single isolate. No differences in diversity following implementation of ACT use were found at any of the seven sites, nor was there evidence of selective pressures acting on the locus. Our results suggest that selection by ACTs is not impacting on K13PD diversity in Uganda.",2019,Uganda

For putative drug transporters, we found continued evolution toward wild-type sequences associated with increased sensitivity to chloroquine. For <i>pfcrt</i> K76T, by 2017 the prevalence of the wild type was >60% at all sites and >90% at 6 sites. For the <i>pfmdr1</i> N86Y and D1246Y alleles, wild type prevalence ranged from 80 to 100%. We found low prevalence of <i>K13</i> propeller domain mutations, which are associated with artemisinin resistance in Asia, but one mutation previously identified in northern Uganda, 675V, was seen in 2.0% of samples, including 5.5% of those from the 3 northernmost sites.

Overall, changes were consistent with the selective pressure of the national treatment regimen, artemether-lumefantrine, with increased sensitivity to chloroquine, and with poor efficacy of antifolates. Strong evidence for resistance to artemisinins was not seen. Continued surveillance of markers that predict antimalarial drug sensitivity is warranted.",2019,Uganda

Malaria transmission is seasonal and transmission intensity varies mainly by landscape and climate. Although the recent emergence of drug resistant parasites presents a major issue to malaria control in Ethiopia, little is known about the transmission pathways of parasite species and prevalence of resistant markers. This study used microsatellites to determine population diversity and gene flow patterns of P. falciparum (N = 226) and P. vivax (N = 205), as well as prevalence of drug resistant markers to infer the impact of gene flow and existing malaria treatment regimes. Plasmodium falciparum indicated a higher rate of polyclonal infections than P. vivax. Both species revealed moderate genetic diversity and similar population structure. Populations in the northern highlands were closely related to the eastern Rift Valley, but slightly distinct from the southern basin area. Gene flow via human migrations between the northern and eastern populations were frequent and mostly bidirectional. Landscape genetic analyses indicated that environmental heterogeneity and geographical distance did not constrain parasite gene flow. This may partly explain similar patterns of resistant marker prevalence. In P. falciparum, a high prevalence of mutant alleles was detected in codons related to chloroquine (pfcrt and pfmdr1) and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (pfdhps and pfdhfr) resistance. Over 60% of the samples showed pfmdr1 duplications. Nevertheless, no mutation was detected in pfK13 that relates to artemisinin resistance. In P. vivax, while sequences of pvcrt-o were highly conserved and less than 5% of the samples showed pvmdr duplications, over 50% of the samples had pvmdr1 976F mutation. It remains to be tested if this mutation relates to chloroquine resistance.

However, this data is largely absent from high-burden nations in Africa, and to date, no such analysis has been conducted for malaria parasites in Tanzania countrywide. To this end, over 1,000 P. falciparum clinical isolates were collected in 2017 from 13 sites in seven administrative regions across Tanzania, and parasites were genotyped at 1,800 variable positions genome-wide using molecular inversion probes. Population structure was detectable among Tanzanian P. falciparum parasites, approximately separating parasites from the northern and southern districts and identifying genetically admixed populations in the north. Isolates from nearby districts were more likely to be genetically related compared to parasites sampled from more distant districts. Known drug resistance mutations were seen at increased frequency in northern districts (including two infections carrying pfk13-R561H), and additional variants with undetermined significance for antimalarial resistance also varied by geography.

To date, the combination of amodiaquine-artesunate is among the drug of choice for treatment of uncomplicated malaria. In this combination, a short acting, artesunate is partnered with long acting, amodiaquine for which resistance may emerge rapidly especially in high transmission settings. Here, we used a rodent malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> ANKA as a surrogate of <i>P. falciparum</i> to investigate the mechanisms of amodiaquine resistance. <b>Methods</b>: We used serial technique to select amodiaquine resistance by submitting the parasites to continuous amodiaquine pressure. We then employed the 4-Day Suppressive Test to monitor emergence of resistance and determine the cross-resistance profiles. Finally, we genotyped the resistant parasite by PCR amplification, sequencing and relative quantitation of mRNA transcript of targeted genes. <b>Results:</b> Submission of <i>P. berghei</i> ANKA to amodiaquine pressure yielded resistant parasite within thirty-six passages. The effective dosage that reduced 90% of parasitaemia (ED <sub>90</sub>) of sensitive line and resistant line were 4.29mg/kg and 19.13mg/kg, respectively. After freezing at -80ÂºC for one month, the resistant parasite remained stable with an ED <sub>90</sub> of 18.22mg/kg. Amodiaquine resistant parasites are also resistant to chloroquine (6fold), artemether (10fold), primaquine (5fold), piperaquine (2fold) and lumefantrine (3fold). Sequence analysis of <i>Plasmodium berghei chloroquine resistant transporter</i> revealed His95Pro mutation. No variation was identified in <i>Plasmodium berghei multidrug resistance gene-1 (Pbmdr1), Plasmodium berghei deubiquitinating enzyme-1</i> or <i>Plasmodium berghei Kelch13 domain</i> nucleotide sequences.

To date, as many as 60 nonsynonymous mutations have been identified in this gene, but whether these mutations have been selected by artemisinin usage or merely reflect natural polymorphism independent of selection is currently unknown. To clarify this, we sequenced the Pfkelch13 propeller domain in 581 isolates collected before (420 isolates) and after (161 isolates) the implementation of artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), from various regions of endemicity worldwide. Nonsynonymous mutations were observed in 1% of parasites isolated prior to the introduction of ACTs. Frequencies of mutant isolates, nucleotide diversity, and haplotype diversity were significantly higher in the parasites isolated from populations exposed to artemisinin than in those from populations that had not been exposed to the drug. In the artemisinin-exposed population, a significant excess of dN compared to dS was observed, suggesting the presence of positive selection. In contrast, pairwise comparison of dN and dS and the McDonald and Kreitman test indicate that purifying selection acts on the Pfkelch13 propeller domain in populations not exposed to ACTs. These population genetic analyses reveal a low baseline of Pfkelch13 polymorphism, probably due to purifying selection in the absence of artemisinin selection.

Emergence of PfART-R in Africa would result in a major public health problem. In this systematic review, we investigate the frequency and spatial distribution of Pfkelch13 mutants in Africa, including mutants linked to PfART-R in southeast Asia. Seven databases were searched (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, African Journal Online, African Index Medicus, Bioline, and Web of Science) for relevant articles about polymorphisms of the Pfkelch13 gene in Africa before January, 2019. Following PRISMA guidelines, 53 studies that sequenced the Pfkelch13 gene of 23 100 sample isolates in 41 sub-Saharan African countries were included. The Pfkelch13 sequence was highly polymorphic (292 alleles, including 255 in the Pfkelch13-propeller domain) but with mutations occurring at very low relative frequencies. Non-synonymous mutations were found in only 626 isolates (2Â·7%) from west, central, and east Africa. According to WHO, nine different mutations linked to PfART-R in southeast Asia (Phe446Ile, Cys469Tyr, Met476Ile, Arg515Lys, Ser522Cys, Pro553Leu, Val568Gly, Pro574Leu, and Ala675Val) were detected, mainly in east Africa. Several other Pfkelch13 mutations, such as those structurally similar to southeast Asia PfART-R mutations, were also identified, but their relevance for drug resistance is still unknown. This systematic review shows that Africa, thought to not have established PfART-R, reported resistance-related mutants in the past 5 years.

Mutations in the propeller domain of the pfk13 gene were identified as molecular markers of artemisinin resistance (ART-R). This study investigated the pfk13-propeller gene polymorphism in clinical isolates of P. falciparum collected in the DRC. In 2017, ten geographical sites across DRC were selected for a cross-sectional study that was conducted first in Kinshasa from January to March, then in the nine other sites from September to December. Dried blood samples were collected from patients attending health centers for fever where diagnosis of Malaria was first made by rapid diagnostic test (RDT) available on site (SD Bioline malaria Ag Pf or CareStart Malaria Pf) or by thick blood smear and then confirmed by a P. falciparum real-time PCR assay. A pfk13-propeller segment containing a fragment that codes for amino acids at positions 427-595 was amplified by conventional PCR before sequencing. In total, 1070 patients were enrolled in the study. Real-time PCR performed confirmed the initial diagnosis of P. falciparum infection in 806 samples (75.3%; 95% CI: 72.6%- 77.9%).

Nonsynonymous polymorphisms in fd (ferredoxin), arps10 (apicoplast ribosomal protein S10), mdr2 (multidrug resistance protein 2) and crt (chloroquine resistance transporter) also showed strong associations with artemisinin resistance. Analysis of the fine structure of the parasite population showed that the fd, arps10, mdr2 and crt polymorphisms are markers of a genetic background on which kelch13 mutations are particularly likely to arise and that they correlate with the contemporary geographical boundaries and population frequencies of artemisinin resistance.

Artemisinin-resistant parasites also exhibit decelerated progression through the first part of the asexual intraerythrocytic development cycle. These findings suggest that artemisinin-resistant parasites remain in a state of decelerated development at the young ring stage, whereas their up-regulated UPR pathways mitigate protein damage caused by artemisinin.
